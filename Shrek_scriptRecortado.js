SHREK

Written by

William Steig & Ted Elliott

SHREK
Once upon a time there was a lovely 
princess. But she had an enchantment 
upon her of a fearful sort which could 
only be broken by love's first kiss. 
She was locked away in a castle guarded 
by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
Many brave knights had attempted to 
free her from this dreadful prison, 
but non prevailed. She waited in the 
dragon's keep in the highest room of 
the tallest tower for her true love 
and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
a load of - (toilet flush)

Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
after the ogre.

NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

MAN1
Think it's in there?

MAN2
All right. Let's get it!

MAN1
Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
thing can do to you?

MAN3
Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
bread.

Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

SHREK
Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
They'll make a suit from your freshly 
peeled skin.

MEN
No!

SHREK
They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
quite good on toast.

MAN1
Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
(waves the torch at Shrek.)

Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
men are in the dark.

SHREK
This is the part where you run away. 
(The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) 
And stay out! (looks down and picks 
up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. 
Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and 
throws the paper over his shoulder.)


THE NEXT DAY

There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
little pigs.

GUARD
All right. This one's full. Take it 
away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!


HEAD GUARD
Next!

GUARD
(taking the witch's broom) Give me that! 
Your flying days are over. (breaks the 
broom in half)

HEAD GUARD
That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
Next!

GUARD
Get up! Come on!

HEAD GUARD
Twenty pieces.

LITTLE BEAR
(crying) This cage is too small.

DONKEY
Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
Give me another chance!

OLD WOMAN
Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

DONKEY
Oh!

HEAD GUARD
Next! What have you got?

GIPETTO
This little wooden puppet.

PINOCCHIO
I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his 
nose grows)

HEAD GUARD
Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
Take it away.

PINOCCHIO
Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
Help me!

Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
to the table.

HEAD GUARD
Next! What have you got?

OLD WOMAN
Well, I've got a talking donkey.

HEAD GUARD
Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
if you can prove it.

OLD WOMAN
Oh, go ahead, little fella.

Donkey just looks up at her.

HEAD GUARD
Well?

OLD WOMAN
Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
Talk, you boneheaded dolt...

HEAD GUARD
That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!


OLD WOMAN
No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends 
to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to 
talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
you ever saw.

HEAD GUARD
Get her out of my sight.

OLD WOMAN
No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
with fairy dust and he's able to fly.

DONKEY
Hey! I can fly!

PETER PAN
He can fly!

3 LITTLE PIGS
He can fly!

HEAD GUARD
He can talk!

DONKEY
Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
a flying, talking donkey. You might 
have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly 
but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey 
fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins 
to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink 
to the ground.)

He hits the ground with a thud.

HEAD GUARD
Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) 
After him!

GUARDS
He's getting away! Get him! This way! 
Turn!

Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He 
quickly hides behind Shrek.

HEAD GUARD
You there. Ogre!

SHREK
Aye?

HEAD GUARD
By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized 
to place you both under arrest and transport 
you to a designated resettlement facility.


SHREK
Oh, really? You and what army?

He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
begins walking back to his cottage.

DONKEY
Can I say something to you? Listen, 
you was really, really, really somethin' 
back here. Incredible!

SHREK
Are you talkin' to...(he turns around 
and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back 
around and Donkey is right in front 
of him.) Whoa!

DONKEY
Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell 
you that you that you was great back 
here? Those guards! They thought they 
was all of that. Then you showed up, 
and bam! They was trippin' over themselves 
like babes in the woods. That really 
made me feel good to see that.

SHREK
Oh, that's great. Really.

DONKEY
Man, it's good to be free.

SHREK
Now, why don't you go celebrate your 
freedom with your own friends? Hmm?


DONKEY
But, uh, I don't have any friends. And 
I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, 
wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll 
stick with you. You're mean, green, 
fightin' machine. Together we'll scare 
the spit out of anybody that crosses 
us.

Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very 
loudly.

DONKEY
Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
don't mind me sayin', if that don't 
work, your breath certainly will get 
the job done, 'cause you definitely 
need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause 
you breath stinks! You almost burned 
the hair outta my nose, just like the 
time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey 
continues to talk, so Shrek removes 
his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten 
berries. I had strong gases leaking 
out of my butt that day.

SHREK
Why are you following me?

DONKEY
I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause 
I'm all alone, There's no one here beside 
me, My problems have all gone, There's 
no one to deride me, But you gotta have 
faith...

SHREK
Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't 
have any friends.

DONKEY
Wow. Only a true friend would be that 
cruelly honest.

SHREK
Listen, little donkey. Take a look at 
me. What am I?

DONKEY
(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really 
tall?

SHREK
No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your 
torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that 
bother you?

DONKEY
Nope.

SHREK
Really?

DONKEY
Really, really.

SHREK
Oh.

DONKEY
Man, I like you. What's you name?

SHREK
Uh, Shrek.

DONKEY
Shrek? Well, you know what I like about 
you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me 
thing. I like that. I respect that, 
Shrek. You all right. (They come over 
a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) 
Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live 
in place like that?

SHREK
That would be my home.

DONKEY
Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. 
You know you are quite a decorator. 
It's amazing what you've done with such 
a modest budget. I like that boulder. 
That is a nice boulder. I guess you 
don't entertain much, do you?

SHREK
I like my privacy.

DONKEY
You know, I do too. That's another thing 
we have in common. Like I hate it when 
you got somebody in your face. You've 
trying to give them a hint, and they 
won't leave. There's that awkward silence. 
(awkward silence) Can I stay with you?


SHREK
Uh, what?

DONKEY
Can I stay with you, please?

SHREK
(sarcastically) Of course!

DONKEY
Really?

SHREK
No.

DONKEY
Please! I don't wanna go back there! 
You don't know what it's like to be 
considered a freak. (pause while he 
looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. 
But that's why we gotta stick together. 
You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!


SHREK
Okay! Okay! But one night only.

DONKEY
Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)


SHREK
What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto 
a chair.) No! No!

DONKEY
This is gonna be fun! We can stay up 
late, swappin' manly stories, and in 
the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.

SHREK
Oh!

DONKEY
Where do, uh, I sleep?

SHREK
(irritated) Outside!

DONKEY
Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, 
I don't know you, and you don't know 
me, so I guess outside is best, you 
know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek 
slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do 
like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was 
born outside. I'll just be sitting by 
myself outside, I guess, you know. By 
myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's 
no one here beside me...

SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights 
a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a 
noise. He stands up with a huff.

SHREK
(to Donkey) I thought I told you to 
stay outside.

DONKEY
(from the window) I am outside.

There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that 
made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns 
and spots 3 blind mice on his table.

BLIND MOUSE1
Well, gents, it's a far cry from the 
farm, but what choice do we have?


BLIND MOUSE2
It's not home, but it'll do just fine.


GORDO
(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.


SHREK
Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes 
and lands on his shoulder.)

GORDO
I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's 
ear)

SHREK
Ow!

GORDO
Blah! Awful stuff.

BLIND MOUSE1
Is that you, Gordo?

GORDO
How did you know?

SHREK
Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are 
you doing in my house? (He gets bumped 
from behind and he drops the mice.) 
Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves 
with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, 
no, no. Dead broad off the table.


DWARF
Where are we supposed to put her? The 
bed's taken.

SHREK
Huh?

Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. 
The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at 
him.

BIG BAD WOLF
What?

TIME LAPSE

Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging 
him to the front door.

SHREK
I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm 
a terrifying ogre! What do I have to 
do get a little privacy? (He opens the 
front door to throw the Wolf out and 
he sees that all the collected Fairy 
Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, 
no. No! No!

The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his 
pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing 
flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.


SHREK
What are you doing in my swamp? (this 
echoes and everyone falls silent.)


Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a 
tent.

SHREK
All right, get out of here. All of you, 
move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! 
Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more 
dwarves run inside the house) No, no! 
No, no. Not there. Not there. (they 
shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to 
look at Donkey)

DONKEY
Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite 
them.

PINOCCHIO
Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

SHREK
What?

PINOCCHIO
We were forced to come here.

SHREK
(flabbergasted) By who?

LITTLE PIG
Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed 
and he...signed an eviction notice.


SHREK
(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where 
this Farquaad guy is?

Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.

DONKEY
Oh, I do. I know where he is.

SHREK
Does anyone else know where to find 
him? Anyone at all?

DONKEY
Me! Me!

SHREK
Anyone?

DONKEY
Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! 
Me, me!

SHREK
(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy 
tale things. Do not get comfortable. 
Your welcome is officially worn out. 
In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad 
right now and get you all off my land 
and back where you came from! (Pause. 
Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) 
You! You're comin' with me.

DONKEY
All right, that's what I like to hear, 
man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart 
friends, off on a whirlwind big-city 
adventure. I love it!

DONKEY
(singing) On the road again. Sing it 
with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get 
on the road again.

SHREK
What did I say about singing?

DONKEY
Can I whistle?

SHREK
No.

DONKEY
Can I hum it?

SHREK
All right, hum it.

Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

DULOC - KITCHEN

A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually 
dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.

FARQUAAD
That's enough. He's ready to talk.


The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.


FARQUAAD
(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs 
and plays with them) Run, run, run, 
as fast as you can. You can't catch 
me. I'm the gingerbread man.

GINGERBREAD MAN
You are a monster.

FARQUAAD
I'm not the monster here. You are. You 
and the rest of that fairy tale trash, 
poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell 
me! Where are the others?

GINGERBREAD MAN
Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's 
eye.)

FARQUAAD
I've tried to be fair to you creatures. 
Now my patience has reached its end! 
Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to 
pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)


GINGERBREAD MAN
No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop 
buttons.

FARQUAAD
All right then. Who's hiding them?


GINGERBREAD MAN
Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the 
muffin man?

FARQUAAD
The muffin man?

GINGERBREAD MAN
The muffin man.

FARQUAAD
Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives 
on Drury Lane?

GINGERBREAD MAN
Well, she's married to the muffin man.


FARQUAAD
The muffin man?

GINGERBREAD MAN
The muffin man!

FARQUAAD
She's married to the muffin man.

The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.

HEAD GUARD
My lord! We found it.

FARQUAAD
Then what are you waiting for? Bring 
it in.

More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. 
They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic 
Mirror.

GINGERBREAD MAN
(in awe) Ohhhh...

FARQUAAD
Magic mirror...

GINGERBREAD MAN
Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks 
him up and dumps him into a trash can 
with a lid.) No!

FARQUAAD
Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. 
Is this not the most perfect kingdom 
of them all?

MIRROR
Well, technically you're not a king.


FARQUAAD
Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a 
hand mirror and smashes it with his 
fist.) You were saying?

MIRROR
What I mean is you're not a king yet. 
But you can become one. All you have 
to do is marry a princess.

FARQUAAD
Go on.

MIRROR
(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back 
and relax, my lord, because it's time 
for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
And here they are! Bachelorette number 
one is a mentally abused shut-in from 
a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi 
and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies 
include cooking and cleaning for her 
two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. 
(shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette 
number two is a cape-wearing girl from 
the land of fancy. Although she lives 
with seven other men, she's not easy. 
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and 
find out what a live wire she is. Come 
on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows 
picture of Snow White) And last, but 
certainly not last, bachelorette number 
three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded 
castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
But don't let that cool you off. She's 
a loaded pistol who likes pina colads 
and getting caught in the rain. Yours 
for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows 
picture of Princess Fiona) So will it 
be bachelorette number one, bachelorette 
number two or bachelorette number three?


GUARDS
Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!


FARQUAAD
Three? One? Three?

THELONIUS
Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number 
three, my lord!

FARQUAAD
Okay, okay, uh, number three!

MIRROR
Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess 
Fiona.

FARQUAAD
Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I 
have to do is just find someone who 
can go...

MIRROR
But I probably should mention the little 
thing that happens at night.

FARQUAAD
I'll do it.

MIRROR
Yes, but after sunset...

FARQUAAD
Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona 
my queen, and DuLoc will finally have 
the perfect king! Captain, assemble 
your finest men. We're going to have 
a tournament. (smiles evilly)

DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section

Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking 
lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.

DONKEY
But that's it. That's it right there. 
That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.


SHREK
So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.


DONKEY
Uh-huh. That's the place.

SHREK
Do you think maybe he's compensating 
for something? (He laughs, but then 
groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. 
He continues walking through the parking 
lot.)

DONKEY
Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

MAN
Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.


SHREK
Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing 
a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, 
screams and begins running through the 
rows of rope to get to the front gate 
to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. 
Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just 
- - I just - - (He sighs and then begins 
walking straight through the rows. The 
attendant runs into a wall and falls 
down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then 
continue on into DuLoc.)

DULOC

They look around but all is quiet.

SHREK
It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?


DONKEY
Hey, look at this!

Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box 
marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors 
open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin 
to sing.

WOODEN PEOPLE
Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town


Here we have some rules

Let us lay them down

Don't make waves, stay in line

And we'll get along fine

DuLoc is perfect place

Please keep off of the grass

Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

DuLoc is, DuLoc is

DuLoc is perfect place.

Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.

DONKEY
Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready 
to run over and pull the lever again)


SHREK
(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) 
No. No. No, no, no! No.

They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.

FARQUAAD
Brave knights. You are the best and 
brightest in all the land. Today one 
of you shall prove himself...

As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena 
Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.

SHREK
All right. You're going the right way 
for a smacked bottom.

DONKEY
Sorry about that.

FARQUAAD
That champion shall have the honor - 
- no, no - - the privilege to go forth 
and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona 
from the fiery keep of the dragon. If 
for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, 
the first runner-up will take his place 
and so on and so forth. Some of you 
may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing 
to make. (cheers) Let the tournament 
begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is 
that? It's hideous!

SHREK
(turns to look at Donkey and then back 
at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. 
It's just a donkey.

FARQUAAD
Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who 
kills the ogre will be named champion! 
Have it him!

MEN
Get him!

SHREK
Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps 
into a table where there are mugs of 
beer)

CROWD
Go ahead! Get him!

SHREK
(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just 
settle this over a pint?

CROWD
Kill the beast!


FIONA
But we have to savor this moment! You 
could recite an epic poem for me. A 
ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!


SHREK
I don't think so.

FIONA
Can I at least know the name of my champion?


SHREK
Uh, Shrek.

FIONA
Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds 
out a handkerchief) I pray that you 
take this favor as a token of my gratitude.


SHREK
Thanks!

Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.

FIONA
(surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?


SHREK
It's on my to-do list. Now come on! 
(takes off running and drags Fiona behind 
him.)

FIONA
But this isn't right! You were meant 
to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. 
That's what all the other knights did.


SHREK
Yeah, right before they burst into flame.


FIONA
That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly 
stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek 
ignores her and heads for a wooden door 
off to the side.) Wait. Where are you 
going? The exit's over there.

SHREK
Well, I have to save my ass.

FIONA
What kind of knight are you?

SHREK
One of a kind. (opens the door into 
the throne room)

SHREK
Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move 
on.

FIONA
Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried 
about Donkey.

SHREK
What?

FIONA
I mean, look at him. He doesn't look 
so good.

DONKEY
What are you talking about? I'm fine.


FIONA
(kneels to look him in the eyes) That's 
what they always say, and then next 
thing you know, you're on your back. 
(pause) Dead.

SHREK
You know, she's right. You look awful. 
Do you want to sit down?

FIONA
Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.


DONKEY
I didn't want to say nothin', but I 
got this twinge in my neck, and when 
I turn my head like this, look, (turns 
his neck in a very sharp way until his 
head is completely sideways) Ow! See?


SHREK
Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.


FIONA
I'll get the firewood.

DONKEY
Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't 
feel my toes! (looks down and yelps) 
I don't have any toes! I think I need 
a hug.


...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm 
a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek 
and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting 
carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet 
which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end 
up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet 
instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now 
has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona 
walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over 
singing the song.

GINGERBREAD MAN
God bless us, every one.

DONKEY
(as he's done singing and we fade to 
black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't 
breathe. I can't breathe.
